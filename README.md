# DNA-Methylation-Analysis-in-Colorectal-Cancer
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with epigenetic modifications playing a crucial role in its progression. The study employs an in silico approach to analyse DNA methylation patterns in CRC, aiming to identify potential prognostic biomarkers that could enhance early detection and guide therapeutic decision-making. Publicly available methylation dataset from NCBI GEO were utilized for differential methylation analysis, Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis, and pathway enrichment studies. Advanced bioinformatics techniques, including statistical modelling, machine learning-based feature selection (random forest classifier), and functional enrichment analysis, were applied to uncover key methylation-driven alterations linked to CRC prognosis. The findings reveal distinct, differentially methylated CpG sites and their associations with critical oncogenic pathways, providing insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of CRC. This study highlights the significance of DNA methylation as a potential biomarker for CRC prognosis and underscores the importance of integrating computational approaches in epigenetic research. The identified biomarkers and their functional implications may enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform targeted therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
